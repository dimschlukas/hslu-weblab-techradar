# Techradar-Backend

## Install

To install all dependencies, run:

```bash
npm ci
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This spins up the backend and serves it at https://localhost:3000 (3000 is the default port).

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
